Part 1
======

easy_dump shows $1$ at the start which means that the passwords are in MD5 (https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcshadow-file/)
$id$salt$hashed is the format for the password field
The salt is used to help make the hash of the password different and protect the password against dictionary attacks.

easy_dump was easily cracked by running john with the given password.list on /A1/easy_dump
./john --wordlist=password.lst /A1/easy_dump

medium_dump
===========
Using: `~./john --wordlist=password.lst /A1/medium_dump` only cracked 1 password, I needed to specify rules to crack the rest of the passwords.
Using: `./john --wordlist=/usr/share/dict/words --rules:Jumbo /A1/medium_dump` ended with only 9/10 of the passwords cracked in total.

hard_dump
=========
Using: `./john --wordlist=/usr/share/dict/words --rules:Jumbo /A1/hard_dump` only cracked 2 of the passwords:
minnesota.       (reymysterio)
minnesot         (ricflair)
Even when it ran for 2 days.



Part 2
======

openssl reports that '9df3b01c60df20d13843841ff0d4482c' is not a bad password for practice_file.aes256.MD5.txt even though the correct password's hash for this file is: '0170d029f1c4a8734e5fede2429ea314'.
